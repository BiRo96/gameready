## FAQ ❓
- **Why not install Bottles?** Because Lutris in my experience works way better and has better compatibility.
- **Why not install [insert driver here]?** Because drivers can be finicky and break systems if done wrong. If you know any drivers that are universally stable and improve gaming in any way, please submit a PR :)
